      "full": "Succubus and Incubus are sexual demons from medieval Christian demonology, with roots in earlier Mesopotamian mythology. A Succubus (female demon) seduces men during sleep, while an Incubus (male demon) seduces women. These entities are described as shape-shifters appearing as attractive humans, draining victims' life force through sexual encounters. Medieval texts claimed they could steal semen from men or impregnate women, sometimes explaining pregnancies out of wedlock or nocturnal emissions. Modern understanding attributes these experiences to sleep paralysis with hypnagogic hallucinations, though the phenomenon appears in folklore worldwide under various names including Lilith, Mara, and Alp."
