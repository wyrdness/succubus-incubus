      "full": "Succubus (female) and Incubus (male) are demons from medieval Christian demonology that seduce humans during sleep, drain life force through sexual encounters, and sometimes steal semen or impregnate victims. These entities are described as shape-shifters appearing as attractive humans, draining victims' life force through sexual contact. Medieval texts claimed they could steal semen from men or use it to impregnate women, explaining both nocturnal emissions and pregnancies out of wedlock. Modern understanding attributes these experiences to **sleep paralysis with hypnagogic hallucinations**, though the phenomenon appears in folklore worldwide under various names including Lilith, Mara, and Alp."
