## Overview

Succubus (female) and Incubus (male) are demons from medieval Christian demonology that seduce humans during sleep, drain life force through sexual encounters, and sometimes steal semen or impregnate victims.

These entities are described as shape-shifters appearing as attractive humans, draining victims' life force through sexual contact. Medieval texts claimed they could steal semen from men or use it to impregnate women, explaining both nocturnal emissions and pregnancies out of wedlock.

Modern understanding attributes these experiences to **sleep paralysis with hypnagogic hallucinations**, though the phenomenon appears in folklore worldwide under various names including Lilith, Mara, and Alp.

### Merlin's Conception (circa 500 CE) 📖

> **Date**: circa 500 CE (legendary)
> **Location**: Wales, Britain
> **Source**: Geoffrey of Monmouth, *Historia Regum Britanniae* (1136)

**Credibility Assessment**: Low — Legendary account with no contemporary documentation, but demonstrates medieval use of incubus belief to explain extraordinary abilities.

> **Period**: 15th-17th centuries
> **Location**: Throughout Europe
> **Sources**: Various witch trial records

## Cultural Sensitivity Note

⚠️ **Historical Persecution**: Belief in succubi/incubi led to thousands of executions during witch trials (1400s-1700s). Confessions were obtained through torture. This represents a dark chapter in European history involving mass persecution.

⚠️ **Active Religious Beliefs**: Some religious traditions still maintain belief in demonic sexual assault. Approach with respect for sincere beliefs while acknowledging scientific understanding.
